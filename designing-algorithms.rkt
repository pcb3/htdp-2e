;== bundle problem

; trivial example: when the list is empty, the chunk size is >=
; length of the list

; solve trivial case by returning the original list

; we generate several new problems. Each new problem is smaller
; by n. The newly generated is simply combining n items from a
; list of items and removing the first n items from the list

; we need to combine the solutions of the generated problems. We
; don't need anything from the original data.

; 0 if s '() or n >= length of s.
; integer division of s by n or
; integer dvision of s by n then add 1 to the result

;== quick-sort< problem

; What is a trivially solvable problem?

; trivail problem is the empty list and when there is only one

; How are trivial solutions solved?
; item in the list

; trivial problem solved by returning the list

;How does the algorithm generate new problems that are more
;easily solvable than the original one? Is there one new problem
;that we generate or are there several?

; The algorithm partitions the list into a pivot and a list
; smaller and larger relative to the pivot. The lists are then
; solved recursively.
