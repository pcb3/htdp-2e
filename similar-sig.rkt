;; 15.2 Similarities in Signatures

;; Exercise 254. Formulate signatures for the following functions:

; [List-of Numbers] [Number Number -> Boolean] -> [List-of Numbers] 

; [List-of Strings] [String String -> Boolean] -> [List-of Strings]

; [x Y] [List-of X] [X X -> Y] -> [List-of X]

; [List-of IR] [IR IR -> Boolean] -> [List-of IR]
